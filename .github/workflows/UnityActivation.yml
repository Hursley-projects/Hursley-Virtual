# This workflow creates a Unity license request file, which needs to be activated at 
# https://license.unity3d.com/manual
#
# Once the license is activated via that link a file will be returned. Copy and paste the 
# contents of that file to secrets.UNITY_LICENSE
#
# Once Stef has given me the IBM license, this shouldn't be needed anymore as it activates personal licenses
